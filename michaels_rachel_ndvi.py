# ## Important  - Assignment Guidelines
# 
# 1. Before you submit your assignment to GitHub, make sure to run the entire notebook with a fresh kernel. To do this first, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\rightarrow$Restart & Run All)
# 2. Always replace the `raise NotImplementedError()` code with your code that addresses the activity challenge. If you don't replace that code, your notebook will not run.
# 
# ```
# # YOUR CODE HERE
# raise NotImplementedError()
# ```
# 
# 3. Any open ended questions will have a "YOUR ANSWER HERE" within a markdown cell. Replace that text with your answer also formatted using Markdown.
# 4. **DO NOT RENAME THIS NOTEBOOK File!** If the file name changes, the autograder will not grade your assignment properly.
# 6. When you create a figure, comment out `plt.show()` to ensure the autograder can grade your plots. For figure cells, DO NOT DELETE the code that says `DO NOT REMOVE LINE BELOW`.
# 
# ```
# ### DO NOT REMOVE LINE BELOW ###
# student_plot1_ax = nb.convert_axes(plt)
# ```
# 
# * Only include the package imports, code, and outputs that are required to run your homework assignment.
# * Be sure that your code can be run on any operating system. This means that:
#    1. the data should be downloaded in the notebook to ensure it's reproducible
#    2. all paths should be created dynamically using the `os.path.join`
# 
# ## Follow to PEP 8 Syntax Guidelines & Documentation
# 
# * Run the `autopep8` tool on all cells prior to submitting (HINT: hit shift + the tool to run it on all cells at once!
# * Use clear and expressive names for variables. 
# * Organize your code to support readability.
# * Check for code line length
# * Use comments and white space sparingly where it is needed
# * Make sure all python imports are at the top of your notebook and follow PEP 8 order conventions
# * Spell check your Notebook before submitting it.
# 
# For all of the plots below, be sure to do the following:
# 
# * Make sure each plot has a clear TITLE and, where appropriate, label the x and y axes. Be sure to include UNITS in your labels.

# # Week 04 and 05 Homework - Automate NDVI Workflow
# 
# For this assignment, you will write code to generate a plot of the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for two different sites in the United States across one year of data:
# 
# * San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) in Southern California, United States
# * Harvard Forest (HARV) in the Northeastern United States
# 
# The data that you will use for this week is available from **earthpy** using the following download: 
# 
# `et.data.get_data('ndvi-automation')`
# 
# ## Assignment Goals
# 
# Your goal in this assignment is to create the most efficient and concise workflow that you can that allows for:
# 
# 1. The code to scale if you added new sites or more time periods to the analysis.
# 2. Someone else to understand your workflow.
# 3. The LEAST and most efficient (i.e. runs fast, minimize repetition) amount of code that completes the task.
# 
# ### HINTS
# 
# * Remove values outside of the landsat valid range of values as specified in the metadata, as needed.
# * Keep any output files SEPARATE FROM input files. Outputs should be created in an outputs directory that is created in the code (if needed) and/or tested for.
# * Use the functions that we demonstrated during class to make your workflow more efficient.
# * BONUS - if you  chose - you can export your data as a csv file. You will get bonus points for doing this.
# 
# 
# ## Assignment Requirements
# 
# Your submission to the GitHub repository should include:
# * This Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) with:
#     * The code to create a plot of mean NDVI across a year for  2 NEON Field Sites:
#         * NDVI on the x axis and formatted dates on the y for both NEON sites on one figure/axis object
#     * The **data should be cleaned to remove the influence of clouds**. See the [earthdatascience website for an example of what your plot might look like with and without removal of clouds](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/create-efficient-data-workflows/).
# * BONUS: Create one output `.csv` file that has 3 columns - NDVI, Date and Site Name - with values for SJER and HARV.
# 
# Your notebook should:
# * Have *at least* 2 well documented and well named functions with docstrings.
# * Include a Markdown cell at the top of the notebook that outlines the overall workflow using pseudocode (i.e. plain language, not code)
# * Include additional Markdown cells throughout the notebook to describe: 
#     * the data that you used - and where it is from
#     * how data are being processing
#     * how the code is optimized to run fast and be more concise

# # Replace this cell with your pseudocode  for this workflow
# 
# If you happen to be a diagram person a diagram is ok too
# 
# 

# 1.	Import required packages
# 2.	Download the data
# 3.	Set the working directory.
# 4.	Create paths to sites
# 5.	Create cloud mask â€“ get the cloud pixel values from earthpy
# 6.	Create a function to extract site name and datetime from directory path names, using the path to the directory that contains the information of interest and the date and site name location within that directory path as index lists as the function parameters
# 7.	Create a function that will open, crop and specify valid ranges of a landsat band, using the path to the band, the cropping extent, and the valid range as function parameters
# 8.	Create dataframe of mean NDVI
#     a.	Create an empty list that will hold site, date, and mean NDVI information
#     b.	Create a for loop to loop through site paths
#             i.	Get list of scene paths of both sites using glob
#             ii.	Get shapefiles for each site using glob and pulling out index 0
#             iii.	Open shapefiles
#             iv.	Create a nested for loop to loop through each scene
#                 1.	Go through each scene directory and pull out date and site information using the function created earlier in the notebook
#                 2.	Go through each scene and create sorted list of bands in each scene using glob. Only bands 4 and 5 are needed for calculating NDVI
#                 3.	Go through each scene and get qa pixel layers using glob and pulling out index 0. This will pop out each qa pixel layer as the loop loops through each scene so that it's not in list form and can be worked with
#                 4.	Open the qa layer
#                 5.	Crop the qa layer using the shapefile opened in the first layer of the loop
#                 6.	Create an empty list that will hold bands 4 and 5 once they are cleaned and free of clouds
#                 7.	Create another for loop inside the already nested loop
#                     a.	Clean the bands using the previously created function that will open the band, crop it using its associate shapefile, and specify landsat's valid range
#                     b.	Apply cloud mask to band
#                     c.	Append list so that it holds the cloud free bands. This list will be used to calculate mean NDVI
#                 8.	Calculate mean NDVI
#                 9.	Append the mean NDVI to the list holding the site information (the function that pulled site and date information from scene directory paths created a list as the output)
#                 10.	Append this list of lists to the empty list created outside the for loop at the top
# 9.	Convert list into a pandas dataframe
# 10.	Set index on date
# 11.	Create figure
#     a.	Set figure space
#     b.	Create overall figure title
#     c.	Create a for loop to loop through dataframe and create individual dataframes grouped by site for plotting
#     d.	Set axes labels
#     e.	Format date on x axis
#     f.	Create a legend
# 12.	Drop na values from dataframe for exporting
# 13.	Export pandas dataframe to .csv file
# 14. Create a figure that displays mean NDVI at the HARV and SJER locations over a year, with mean NDVI on the y-axis and the month on the x-axis using the pandas dataframe created in the previous step.

# | Date  |   |   |   |
# |  2017-01-07  | 0  | SJER  | .4  |  
# 
# Be sure to call your dataframe at the end of the cell to ensure autograding works.
# HINT: FOR THIS STEP, leave any rows containing missing values (`NAN`).

# 1. Create dataframe of mean NDVI a. Create an empty list that will hold site, date, and mean NDVI information b. Create a for loop to loop through site paths
#         i.    Get list of scene paths of both sites using glob
#         ii.    Get shapefiles for each site using glob and pulling out index 0
#         iii.    Open shapefiles
#         iv.    Create a nested for loop to loop through each scene
#             1.    Go through each scene directory and pull out date and site information using the function created earlier in the notebook
#             2.    Go through each scene and create sorted list of bands in each scene using glob. Only bands 4 and 5 are needed for calculating NDVI
#             3.    Go through each scene and get qa pixel layers using glob and pulling out index 0. This will pop out each qa pixel layer as the loop loops through each scene so that it's not in list form and can be worked with
#             4.    Open the qa layer
#             5.    Crop the qa layer using the shapefile opened in the first layer of the loop
#             6.    Create an empty list that will hold bands 4 and 5 once they are cleaned and free of clouds
#             7.    Create another for loop inside the already nested loop
#                 a.    Clean the bands using the previously created function that will open the band, crop it using its associate shapefile, and specify landsat's valid range
#                 b.    Apply cloud mask to band
#                 c.    Append list so that it holds the cloud free bands. This list will be used to calculate mean NDVI
#             8.    Calculate mean NDVI
#             9.    Append the mean NDVI to the list holding the site information (the function that pulled site and date information from scene directory paths created a list as the output)
#             10.    Append this list of lists to the empty list created outside the for loop at the top

# # Question 1 (10 points)
# 
# Imagine that you are planning NEONâ€™s upcoming flight season to capture remote sensing data in these locations and want to ensure that you fly the area when the vegetation is the most green.
# 
# When would you recommend the flights take place for each site? 
# 
# Answer the question in 2-3 sentences in the Markdown cell below.

# I would recommend that the flights take place in April for the SJER site. I would recommend that HARV flights take place in July.

# # Question 2 (10 points)
# 
# How could you modify your workflow to look at vegetation changes over time in each site? 
# 
# Answer the question in 2-3 sentences in the Markdown cell below.

# I could possibly create NDVI difference maps to examine changes between time points (months, years, etc.). Due to the way my code is set up, I could also continue to add data to the HARV and SJER directories as it becomes available and run this same code to continue to monitor changes.

# # Do not edit this cell! (10 points)
# 
# The notebook includes:
# * additional Markdown cells throughout the notebook to describe: 
#     * the data that you used - and where it is from
#     * how data are being processing
#     * how the code is optimized to run fast and be more concise

# # Do not edit this cell! (20 points)
# 
# The notebook will also be checked for overall clean code requirements as specified at the **top** of this notebook. Some of these requirements include (review the top cells for more specifics): 
# 
# * Notebook begins at cell [1] and runs on any machine in its entirety.
# * PEP 8 format is applied throughout (including lengths of comment and code lines).
# * No additional code or imports in the notebook that is not needed for the workflow.
# * Notebook is fully reproducible. This means:
#    * reproducible paths using the os module.
#    * data downloaded using code in the notebook.
#    * all imports at top of notebook.

# ## BONUS - Export a  .CSV File to Share (10 points possible)
# 
# This is optional - if you export a **.csv** file with the columns specified above: Site, Date and NDVI Value you can get an additional 10 points.
# 
# * FULL CREDIT: File exists in csv format and contains the columns specified.
# We will check your github repo for this file!
