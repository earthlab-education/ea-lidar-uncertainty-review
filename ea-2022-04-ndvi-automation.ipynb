    "\n",
    "1. Before you submit your assignment to GitHub, make sure to run the entire notebook with a fresh kernel. To do this first, **restart the kernel ** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart & Run All)\n",
    "2. Always replace the `raise NotImplementedError()` code with your code that addresses the activity challenge. If you don't replace that code, your notebook will not run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# YOUR CODE HERE\n",
    "raise NotImplementedError()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Any open ended questions will have a \"YOUR ANSWER HERE\" within a markdown cell. Replace that text with your answer also formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "4. ** DO NOT RENAME THIS NOTEBOOK File!** If the file name changes, the autograder will not grade your assignment properly.\n",
    "6. When you create a figure, comment out `plt.show()` to ensure the autograder can grade your plots. For figure cells, DO NOT DELETE the code that says `DO NOT REMOVE LINE BELOW`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### DO NOT REMOVE LINE BELOW ###\n",
    "student_plot1_ax = nb.convert_axes(plt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only include the package imports, code, and outputs that are required to run your homework assignment.\n",
    "* Be sure that your code can be run on any operating system. This means that:\n",
    "   1. the data should be downloaded in the notebook to ensure it's reproducible\n",
    "   2. all paths should be created dynamically using the `os.path.join`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Follow to PEP 8 Syntax Guidelines & Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run the `autopep8` tool on all cells prior to submitting(HINT: hit shift + the tool to run it on all cells at once!\n",
    "* Use clear and expressive names for variables.\n",
    "* Organize your code to support readability.\n",
    "* Check for code line length\n",
    "* Use comments and white space sparingly where it is needed\n",
    "* Make sure all python imports are at the top of your notebook and follow PEP 8 order conventions\n",
    "* Spell check your Notebook before submitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the plots below, be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure each plot has a clear TITLE and , where appropriate, label the x and y axes. Be sure to include UNITS in your labels.\n"

    "# Week 04 and 05 Homework - Automate NDVI Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will write code to generate a plot of the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for two different sites in the United States across one year of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) in Southern California, United States\n",
    "* Harvard Forest (HARV) in the Northeastern United States\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that you will use for this week is available from **earthpy** using the following download: \n",
    "\n",
    "`et.data.get_data('ndvi-automation')`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this assignment is to create the most efficient and concise workflow that you can that allows for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code to scale if you added new sites or more time periods to the analysis.\n",
    "2. Someone else to understand your workflow.\n",
    "3. The LEAST and most efficient (i.e. runs fast, minimize repetition) amount of code that completes the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HINTS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove values outside of the landsat valid range of values as specified in the metadata, as needed.\n",
    "* Keep any output files SEPARATE FROM input files. Outputs should be created in an outputs directory that is created in the code (if needed) and/or tested for.\n",
    "* Use the functions that we demonstrated during class to make your workflow more efficient.\n",
    "* BONUS - if you  chose - you can export your data as a csv file. You will get bonus points for doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission to the GitHub repository should include:\n",
    "* This Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) with:\n",
    "    * The code to create a plot of mean NDVI across a year for  2 NEON Field Sites:\n",
    "        * NDVI on the x axis and formatted dates on the y for both NEON sites on one figure/axis object\n",
    "    * The **data should be cleaned to remove the influence of clouds**. See the [earthdatascience website for an example of what your plot might look like with and without removal of clouds](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/create-efficient-data-workflows/).\n",
    "* BONUS: Create one output `.csv` file that has 3 columns - NDVI, Date and Site Name - with values for SJER and HARV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should:\n",
    "* Have *at least* 2 well documented and well named functions with docstrings.\n",
    "* Include a Markdown cell at the top of the notebook that outlines the overall workflow using pseudocode (i.e. plain language, not code)\n",
    "* Include additional Markdown cells throughout the notebook to describe: \n",
    "    * the data that you used - and where it is from\n",
    "    * how data are being processing\n",
    "    * how the code is optimized to run fast and be more concise"
